      <h1>70ch Line Length Test</h1>
      <p>
        This width allows for approximately 15-20 words per line, which balances
        readability with content density. Studies show this works well for users
        who scan content quickly.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Pros</strong>: Fewer line breaks, better for tables/code
        </li>
        <li><strong>Cons</strong>: Slightly harder to track between lines</li>
      </ul>

      <blockquote>
        "Optimal line length depends on context—70ch shines for reference
        material."
